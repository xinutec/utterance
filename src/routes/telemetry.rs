//! Client activity trace: what the browser sees and the API does not.
//!
//! **Why this exists, and it is not analytics.** The per-request trace already
//! logs every API call, and for a long time that was treated as enough. It is
//! not: a press that hits a cache, a knob dragged, a control that was disabled,
//! a page that rendered wrong — none of it reaches the server, so none of it can
//! be diagnosed afterwards. This app is used by one person in another house, and
//! the only report available is "I pressed the button and nothing happened".
//!
//! The events fold into the **same** log stream as the API requests, so a
//! session reads as one timeline: `client-event kind=nav path=/studio`, then
//! `client-event kind=tap label="Render as music"`, then the
//! `GET /api/voice 400` the tap caused. That last line is the one that says what
//! went wrong, and the two before it are what say who asked for it.
//!
//! **There is no storage here.** These are logs, not data. The endpoint moves
//! the client's events into the backend log and forgets them.
//!
//! Ported from the `life` app, which has had this since 2026-07-17. The only
//! differences are that there is no per-request user to attribute to — this
//! deployment is one account — and that the gate is middleware rather than an
//! extractor, so the session is checked before a handler is reached at all.
