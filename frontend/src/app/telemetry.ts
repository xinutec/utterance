/**
 * What the person did, folded into the backend's log beside what the API saw.
 *
 * **The gap this closes.** The per-request trace records every API call, and
 * that was treated as sufficient for a long time. It is not: a press that hits a
 * cache, a knob dragged, a disabled control, a page that rendered wrong — none
 * of it reaches the server. This app is used by one person in another house, and
 * the report available is "I pressed the button and nothing happened". Read
 * together, the two streams make that diagnosable.
 *
 * **Instrumented once, here.** Two central seams — the router's navigation
 * events, and a single capture-phase click listener — so no page knows this
 * exists and no new control can be missed by forgetting to annotate it.
 *
 * Best-effort by design: a failed send is dropped, never retried, never
 * surfaced. A trace that interferes with the app it observes is worse than no
 * trace at all.
