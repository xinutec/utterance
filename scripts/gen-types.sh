# All this file holds is the part that is this repository's: where the bindings
# live and how to make cargo emit them. The rest — generate into a scratch
# directory and install only on success, refuse a generation that emitted
# nothing, copy the types and not whatever else landed beside them, compare by
# content rather than by asking git — is dev-lint#gen-types, shared with the
# four other repositories that had each grown their own version of it.
# scripts/check-types.sh is gone with it.
#
# `--features ts` turns ts-rs on (off in normal builds). `--workspace` so
# utterance-analysis's voiceprint types export alongside the server's wire types.
# The export tests are named export_bindings_*, so the filter runs generation only.
